# Disable body scroll on mouse enter

This project is a proof of concept created to make the body of an app stop scrolling if the mouse is hovering over a specific div.

I created this to better undestand the body-scroll-lock and react-cursor-position dependencies in order to implement them in another web app I'm building.

## Stack

- React js
- [body-scroll-lock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-scroll-lock)
- [react-cursor-position](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cursor-position)

### Setup

Run npm start
